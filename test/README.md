Working files,

1. 2test.py is working properly and it is drawing graphs seperately, it makes a graph when until is sees `b`. It starts making a new graph when it sees `b`. I can use this `b` as a condition to draw gseperate graphs.

2. graph-hbw2-test.py is a copy of the file ../graph-hbw2.py. Using the 2test.py to check if it's working fine with all test cases and then I will merge the result inside the file graph-hbw2-test.py
