Working files to create forward tracking graphs,

1. 3test.py is the same file present in the `../test_cases-forwardTr` which is generating graph for a certain range in the forward direction.

2. The `3test-graph-hbw2.py` is using the `../hbw-graph.txt` file present in the `../` dir and creating graph with 1k edges and then seperating it after that.
