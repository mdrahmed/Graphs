## Remove common patterns from 1 file `hbw`
```
python3 remove_patterns.py /home/raihan/Graphs-all/Graphs/backwardTracking/combinedGraph/plagarismFinder/myPlagiarismChecker/tf-idf_usability/hbwall3.txt ../pattern
```

It will create `hbwall3.txt.log` and `hbwall3.txt.out` in the same directory of the `*.txt` file. In this case, it is present inside this folder `/home/raihan/Graphs-all/Graphs/backwardTracking/combinedGraph/plagarismFinder/myPlagiarismChecker/tf-idf_usability/`.
