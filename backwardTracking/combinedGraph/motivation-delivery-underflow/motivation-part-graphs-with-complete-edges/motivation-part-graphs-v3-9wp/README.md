This folder contains a complete stateful graph after storing 9 workpieces in the HBW and then ordering 1 wp from 0,1 and again ordering from 0,1 to show the attack.
The `Wrong-graph-server-at-top` folder contains previous graph, where I showed the server at the top. But the server/portal should be shown below because the order is made from server after the workpieces are stored in the storage.

Input: `topic` or `hbw/ack`, dataset: `motivation-log-v3`
