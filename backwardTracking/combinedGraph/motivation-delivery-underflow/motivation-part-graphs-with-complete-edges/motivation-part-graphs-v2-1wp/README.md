This folder contains a complete stateful graph after storing 1 workpiece at 0,0 and then ordering 1 workpiece from 0,1 to show the attack
The `wrong-graph-server-at-top` folder contains wrong-graphs because I added server the top, but the server/portal is ordering after the workpiece has been stored.
The process of order is following,
```
TOPIC_INPUT_STATE_ORDER  "f/i/order"
TOPIC_OUTPUT_ORDER       "f/o/order"
TOPIC_LOCAL_VGR_DO       "fl/vgr/do"
```
The `delivery-underflow-1wp` file contains readable function names.

Input: `hbw/ack`, dataset: `motivation-log-v2-delivery`
Dataset: 
This folder contains a copy of the dataset used `delivery-underflow-1wp.md` but following is the actual path of the dataset.
```
~/CPS-VVI-LOGS-DATA/All-new-logs/10.2.everything-logged-with-good/delivery-underflow/delivery-underflow-1wp.md
```
