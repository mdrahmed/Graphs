## Finding sub-patterns
To find the sub patterns, we used the `prefixspan`. 
The documentation is [here](https://github.com/chuanconggao/PrefixSpan-py/tree/master#closed-patterns-and-generator-patterns)

Steps:
- Breaking the whole sequence into subsequences with the param `seq_len`
- Then using it to find the common subsequence.
