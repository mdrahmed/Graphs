Working files to create backtracking graphs,

1. `3test.py` is the same file present in the `../test_cases-backwardTr` which is generating graph for a certain range in the backward direction.

2. The `graphViz-bt-hbw2.py` is using the `../hbw-graph.txt` file present in the `../` dir and creating graph with 1k edges and then seperating it after that.

3. The `graphViz-bt-vgr.py` is using `neato` engine to generate graph with more that edge limit. It is creating graphs but the graph is is not viewable.
