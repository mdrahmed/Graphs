Working files,

1. `3test.py` is creating graph for a certain range (1k edges) working fine to find graphs in backward direction.

2. `graphViz-bt-hbw2.py` is creating graph with 1k edges for `hbw-graph.txt`.

3. `graphViz-bt-vgr.py` is creating graph for all the logs present in `../vgr-graph.txt`

4. The `graph without merging` folder is creating graph with `networkx` using all the logs.

5. With this file `graphViz-bt-hbw3.py` tried to make gspan-mining format type of data. But couldn't.

6. **The file `graphViz-bt-hbw4.py`(copy of `..hbw2.py`) will prepare the file in the form of `graph.data` which can be used later for gspan-mining.** => saved this file

7. `graphViz-bt-vgr2.py` is just to check if it is creating the file in the gspan format and working fine. It's a copy of `graphViz-bt-hbw4.py`
