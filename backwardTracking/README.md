Working files to create backtracking graphs,

1. 3test.py is the same file present in the `../test_cases-backwardTr` which is generating graph for a certain range in the backward direction.

2. The graph-bt-hbw2.py is using the `../hbw-graph.txt` file present in the `../` dir and creating graph with 1k edges and then seperating it after that.
